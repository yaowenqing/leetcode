Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. 

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. 

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself. 

For example, 

Given “egg”, “add”, return true. 

Given “foo”, “bar”, return false. 

Given “paper”, “title”, return true. 

>Note: You may assume both s and t have the same length.

### 代码

```
bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        int m1[128] = {0}, m2[128] = {0}, n = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (m1[s[i]] != m2[t[i]]) return false;
            m1[s[i]] = i + 1;
            m2[t[i]] = i + 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
```
